Midterm project for image processing course. 
- Detect traffic signs without labeled data using color and shape-based methods.
- Recognize numbers on images.
Implemented in Python with OpenCV.

## üìñ Introduction
This project demonstrates the use of **image processing techniques** with OpenCV to detect and localize digits in images or videos.  
By applying preprocessing steps such as light balancing, noise reduction, and contour detection, the system can highlight digit regions with bounding boxes.  

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The project focuses only on **digit detection (localization)**.  
It does **not** perform labeling or digit recognition.

## üéØ Objective
- Preprocess images to enhance quality and reduce noise.  
- Detect regions that may contain digits using contours and morphological operations.  
- Draw bounding boxes around detected digits.  
- Provide a simple pipeline that can later be extended to OCR (Optical Character Recognition) or deep learning models.

## üìù Purpose
- Serve as a demonstration of object detection (digit localization) using classical computer vision techniques.  
- Provide a preprocessing step for future OCR or digit recognition systems.  
- Show that even without **labeled data**, it is possible to detect and segment objects (digits) from images or videos.

## üìñ Introduction
This project performs **digit detection in images** using image processing techniques with OpenCV.  
The goal is to detect digits, draw bounding boxes around them, and export the results as images or videos.

## üéØ Objective
The main objective of this project is to **detect and localize digits in images** using computer vision techniques.  
Specifically:
- Preprocess images with OpenCV to enhance contrast and remove noise.  
- Detect digit regions using contour detection and morphological operations.  
- Draw bounding boxes around each detected digit.  
- Provide a preprocessing pipeline that can later be extended to full **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** using deep learning or Tesseract OCR.
